1 - open the docker image
2 - run two instances of the receive.js and one instances of the send.js
3 - send a message as argument from the send.js : node fanout_exchange/emit_logs.js hello


How send works? 
1 - create connection and channel 
2 - assert exchange with type fanout. durable is false because you don't care to keep it when restart
3 - create a publisher with this exchange. The routing key is not important in the fanout type



How receive works?
1 - create connection and channel and fanout exchange
2 - create a queue with random name (don't care what name it has)
3 - exlusive is true to delete this queue automatically when the connection terminates
4 - bind this queue to the logs exchange
5 - consume the message from the receive.js
